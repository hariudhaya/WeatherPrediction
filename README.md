# Javascript Weather App ⛅️

My first ever javascript app made with vanilla JavaScript / No Framework for Javascipt or CSS

Using the OpenWeatherMap API http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

This follows the search by ID for example Lonon or Hull will return the current weather in that location e.g London(GB). All temperature are converted into degrees C from the API return in kelvin

Built with

* VS Code
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
